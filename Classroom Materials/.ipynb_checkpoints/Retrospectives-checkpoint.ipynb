    "# Sprint 1: Data Formats and Terminology Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "**11/19/2017**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Big Data Cohort #1,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preface\n",
    "I’ve been trying to be more aware of the Hawaiian language as its used around me. Over the last week I’ve heard three phrases that were new to me that resonated with the underlying philosophies of the class. I’d like to share them to continue to build the framework of our classroom and learning environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Malama i kekahi i kekahi*: Take care of each other.\n",
    "- *Ma ka hana ka ʻike*: In working one learns\n",
    "- *A’ohe hana nui ke alu ia*: No task is too big when done together by all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sprint Retrospective\n",
    "I think Justin nailed the essence of what this class is designed to do when he said (paraphrasing), *“sometimes it’s just about knowing how to ask google a good question”*\n",
    "\n",
    "A well crafted question captures scope, motivation, plan of attack, and application all at the same time. And while confusion breeds questions easily, formulating a productive question, is anything but easy. But questions connect us to the massive wealth of information and abilities available to us — on the internet, but also embedded in our communities. Questions are our API to our knowledge legacy as a civilization, as a species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extent to which this classroom is succeeding or failing is, in my opinion, measured in its success or failure to support your ability to formulate and answer the questions that underlie your skill-building and professional goals. What are the questions that drive the problems you’re trying to solve or the value you’re trying to create? Did this sprint get you closer to knowing how to answer those questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "I said it before, and I want to re-iterate, the projects you delivered over just 24 hours of classroom time, exceeded my expectations for what was possible for a classroom of self-directed smart people with little to no programming experience. Which, to me, says that the process is working — albeit with considerably more anxiety than any of us thinks is desirable. Or necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the questions that are driving me and the adjustments we make to the next sprint are\n",
    "- *How can we achieve equivalent production with less stress?*\n",
    "- *How can we direct people’s efforts, questions, and projects to maximize the production of job-applicable skills and knowledge?*\n",
    "- *How can we maximize every minute of the time spent in the classroom environment?*\n",
    "- *How can we use the class?*\n",
    "- *How can we empower people to feel like they are gradually becoming more equipped to answer their own questions?*\n",
    "- *How can we continue to map the knowledge space so people can navigate it?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the adjustments I’ll outline below, I have attempted to integrate the feedback from our last sprint retrospective discussion as well as the individual impressions I have gathered from working with each of you. However I expect that I will continue to need your input and would like to request your continuing help. The motivation behind this letter is to make my thought process as transparent as possible so that you might correct it, build on it, steer it in another direction for the benefit of your professional outcomes and those of the rest of the cohort. After reading through the proposed adjustments, I invite your reflections and thoughts in similarly open and structured letters below to continue and deepen this conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scrapping Trello\n",
    "Trello, we hardly knew ye… I think the calls for streamlining the documentation and deliverables for the class make sense and they point to abandoning trello as it is not directly tied to a deliverable. We will need a way to keep track of our overall skill roadmaps and blueprints, as well as keep track of blockers and questions, which leads to the next two adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "### #STUCK / #QUESTION Hashtags on Slack\n",
    "Both for use on slack and for the coaching staff to monitor and address. #STUCK will be something we try to address ASAP and track our performance on. We’ll post the #STUCK Stream on screen during class. So that coaches are available to work with #STUCK requests, right away we will attempt to shorten or at least manage the time we spend with individual students (but will continue to be available for general mentoring if no one else is #STUCK. I’d also encourage you to help each other get #UNSTUCK, as a lot of learning happens in getting #UNSTUCK\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTIONs we’ll track at a higher level and attach to each sprint. In principle, either the projects (and documentation) themselves in combination with the classroom content should address all questions. If not, we’ll need to discuss whether they are relevant or should be carried onto the next sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### “Roadmap” iPython Notebooks\n",
    "I’ll be adding in a set of iPython Notebooks to transfer all of the skill stories you put into Trello. I’ll try to move these over for you to save you the extra work, but I will ask you to edit them. We will be adding a few things, namely a description of your professional vision for yourself after the class. The roadmap will contain your project, your skill story, your learning objectives all in one place so you can constantly be reviewing whether your projects support your skill and learning objectives and whether your skill and learning objectives support your big picture goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of Roadmaps, I would also like to be more deliberate about checking proposed projects against the topics of FUTURE sprints. I should be better about this, but I can use your help. If we expect to cover something later, it may not make sense to pursue a project that does that prematurely before we have time to develop the skills that the future sprint will build upon. There may be a reason to jump ahead, but I just want to make sure that we’re aware of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifying Documentation Structure\n",
    "I thought Hunter’s comment about using the documentation as journaling made the most sense from the standpoint of streamlining the process. I think we will want to use the documentation to track what we are learning and thinking as we do it, and then organize it more coherently into the final project repo / README. The 3 necessary components of project documentation, that I would like to enforce being current at the top at all times\n",
    "1.) A descriptive title of the project\n",
    "2.) A description of the project and how it is helping you learn or develop a skill\n",
    "3.) A running list of what you are learning.\n",
    "Below that can just be headers of individual paths of inquiry or investigation you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buddy System\n",
    "I also really like the suggestion for making more use of pairs / buddy system earlier in the process. I think starting with the concept mapping, we should establish some work being done in pairs. Tori’s idea to link the previous sprint concepts to the current one is something I would recommend here as well. I think having a designated feedback partner to ask questions to before escalating to a coach would be a productive pattern. We should aim for documentation commits at each mid-class break and at the end of every class with checkins with either the whole group or at least your partners with every commit. We’ll rotate partners to maximize exposure to each other’s unique skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily Slack Review Standup\n",
    "For better tracking and to make sure everyone is up to date on slack, we’ll do our daily standup based on what’s in slack. So if you have an blocker, question, or issue you want to discuss, definitely get it into slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pitch Process\n",
    "Speaking of standups, after our first pitch session, there were a few modifications I wanted to make. I want to keep them short, 30 seconds or less. I also prefer alternating between hearing one person and another between pitches, so I think a “pitch circle” might be the best configuration. Finally, when we review the pitches to select projects, we should do that relative to the individual road map. So I propose a side-by-side comparison of the individual’s skill roadmap and all of the proposed projects to pick one that works for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolving the Skill Stories\n",
    "I see some limitations in the way we frame skill stories that are probably contributing to some uncertainty in how to best use them. I’m thinking about how to blend in a few more concepts, without making them overly complicated. A few options (could combine them even) are\n",
    "As a FUTURE __(desired job)__ I need to learn __(skill/concept)__ So that I can __(future job task)__\n",
    "Where the skills / concepts are things you put on your resume\n",
    "Future job tasks are things you may demonstrate with projects or future projects\n",
    "Additionally some stories like the following would capture the skills or interests you bring into the project that you can leverage.\n",
    "As a CURRENT __(current job)__ I need to solve __(current job task)__ problem which I can apply my current project to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guest Speakers / Subject Matter Experts\n",
    "It sounds like including them on Days 1 and/or 2 of the sprint was the general consensus for when they would be most impactful. I think it will make the most sense to start introducing these individuals into the mix with exploratory data analysis or basic data manipulation, so the sprint after next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Tutorials and Basics\n",
    "I thought a lot about this one and the idea of outlining tutorials for using the programs we will be using in the class. The way I’m leaning now is continuing to resist this. Here’s my thinking on it. One of the primary purposes of the class as designed, is how to learn **how to learn** technology the way that you will most commonly be confronted with needing to do so: outside of the traditional classroom environment. Which isn’t to say you will not find those traditional experiences, in fact they’re easy to find everywhere, including online, often free — but I don’t think they will keep up with the pace of the technology you will need to learn in your future careers. What I want to emphasize is how to leverage your community for information, how to direct your questions, and how to piece together the fragments of information and tips and recommendations that come from all of that into actually **doing** stuff. Tutorials and resources exist for all of the stuff we will be working on. \n",
    "We can even work with you to find them. I would actually encourage you to create them as your potential projects! I don’t think us providing them will support the learning how to learn objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To paraphrase Justin through Sheuli’s note on trello: “Most problems that we think we have, someone has probably already solved. We just don’t have the answer to the questions. Start iterating towards the right question.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And while we’re on this general topic, another thing I’ve thought a lot about post-sprint is a comment that several of you made about using technical skills that you didn’t really understand. The general idea being that you just followed a tutorial and copied what they said. In essence, someone else did it for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m actually very much ok with this. I’m much more ok with other people (including the coaches) doing parts of your project “for you” as needed than I am prescribing skills to “learn” through a series of introductions or tutorials. Why? Because some of those skills are not relevant to what you’re trying to learn. If we can help you get to what you’re ultimately trying to learn by fast forwarding a bit, I think that’s what the coaches, and internet tutorials are here to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if those things ARE what you’re trying to learn, we’ll try to resist giving you the easy answers and instead steering you to think about and inquire why things are arranged the way they are or how they would have to be arranged to work and make sense. In my experience, those types of thought exercises produce much better comprehension (even with respect to software tools and not just concepts) than tutorials we write would.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m still open to changing my mind about the need for more explicit support on python / R for example, but if you’d bear with me for now, I’d like to hold out a bit longer and see what we can do without them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### More breaks between sprints\n",
    "Hunter suggested bringing up the idea of spreading out the class longer but taking a week off after each module (every two sprints). It would make the class last apprxomiately 50 weeks instead of 40. It wouldn't really kick in until after the holidays anyway, but I'm not opposed to it if it's something that makes it easier for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Like Babies\n",
    "Sheuli’s comment on this point really hit home for me. A data blog I read recently made the point that he was teaching his young son (about bike riding) that falling is learning. And since that point, his son liked to say about every time he fell: “Don’t worry Dad, falling is learning!” Maybe “learning like babies” should be our new class motto.\n",

    "# Sprint 2: Connecting to Data Sources Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear BDA Cohort,\n",
    "\n",
    "I am, again, really impressed with the advance in technical skills you are demonstrating over the course of this bootcamp. We've just completed our first module on Data formats, and I believe that you have, as a cohort developed a good survey of all of the issues you will encounter related to the topic and a collection of projects and boilerplate work that you can build on in future sprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our last sprint as well as our last sprint retrospective lead to some updates to the sprint process that I think will allow us to use the classroom time more efficiently, and better keep us on track toward our respective ultimate goals as practitioners in this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to all of your suggestions and a lot of help from Tori Larson, I've updated the sprint schedule\n",
    "https://github.com/devleague/BigDataAnalyst_Library/blob/master/Init_and_setup/Sprint%20Board_Updated_2ft_x_3ft.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "and the Sprint Documentation Template\n",
    "https://github.com/devleague/BigDataAnalyst_ProjectDocumentation/blob/master/Sprint03_Data_Operation/Hunter_Heaivilin.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "to structure a more formal process. Here's a quick rundown of a few of the changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting to project work faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "A \"flailing\" prototyping period starts in the first hour of the first day with an accelerated process of getting to initial pitches. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Replacing multiple pitch generation with structured research time\n",
    "\n",
    "developing a customized list of examples to draw work or inspiration from on the first day\n",
    "\n",
    "### More structured pair activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit pair work on the first, second, and fifth days of the sprint to spread out the benefit of pair feedback and communication across more time and more stages of project development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintaining useful technical demonstrations from the class\n",
    "\n",
    "Several people expressed that the work in progress demonstrations were useful, and useful early in the process. Final presentations expressed a competing desire to address big picture conceptual issues and more practical technical learning and technique. These are explicitly separated to allow some time on both, as they are both equally important to skill development\n",
    "\n",
    "### More targeted and better defined presentations \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Pitches, Work in Progress Updates, Project Highlights, and Sprint Review, provide multiple opportunities to communicate your work to a bigger group than just your pair, but are targeted to specific tasks to reduce redundancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spreading out delivery expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than all deliverables be packaged together at the end, they are now structured to be made periodically throughout the sprint, to allow \"project development\" time to track more naturally to the focus of each stage of the sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two days will focus on the delivery of a plan. The second two days, the delivery of a technical project, and the third two days on delivering learning resources and integration. **Essentially a small conference.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capturing all of the things that couldn't be finished in project\n",
    "\n",
    "One common frustration appears to be not having enough time to execute all of the ideas that one can think of during the project. As we develop skills, some of those ideas will also get easier at later stages in the sprint as well as possibly be project ideas for later topics. Capturing these ideas in both roadmaps and project deliverables will start to give us an outlet for these unrealized projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Improvement of End-of-Course Deliverables\n",
    "As we discussed in class, we are essentially developing 3 things over the course of this class.\n",
    "1.) A resume (i.e. portfolio)\n",
    "2.) A textbook (i.e. a shared resource with what we have collectively learned - our information legacy)\n",
    "3.) A facilitation tool (i.e. a set of profiles that lays out your goals, progress, and interests, so that cohort members and coaching staff have information on how to best intervene).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we tweak the format of these deliverables, hopefully their quality and thus their usefulness improves. We've changed the location and structure of the roadmaps, the structure of documentation, and are working to refine the location and structure of sprint review presentations. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'd still like to find more time to discuss roadmaps, and a few other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### onward!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for your continued input and for all of your hard work. I'll keep working to deliver the most out of every hour we spend together in class. Let me know if there are any other improvements you can think of.\n"

    "# Sprint 3: Data Operations Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear BDA Cohort,\n",
    "\n",
    "The holidays were a difficult time to juggle a variety of priorities and I commend all of you for battling through the fatigue and putting a ton of hard work into the projects, which demonstrated quite a bit of technical skill and understanding, and with projects polished off in record time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're in 2018, we're gearing up for the long haul. It's imperative that we set up our sprints in a sustainable manner and that we lay out our learning path to make the most out of the time we spend together as a cohort. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have gotten the impression by now that we have a lot of ground to cover, and the only way we are going to do that is by working together, dividing and conquering, and squeezing every last drop of learning value out of our class time together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If something isn't working for you, now's the time to discuss it. We will cover far more ground as a team, so 1.) be a strong contributor (to a strong team) and 2.) make sure you are getting maximum value out of the interactions with your cohort. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that, onto the adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fear and Anxiety\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is about letting your curiosity and critical process take the lead and getting out of your own way. The biggest obstruction to learning these technical and analytical concepts is fear. Fear that you're won't get it, fear that you won't get it fast enough, fear that your colleagues are learning faster than you, fear that you won't learn enough, fear that your colleagues can't help you, fear that you're wasting your time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The blocks produced by the fears and anxieties we are struggling with is a  real detractor from productivity. Accordingly I think it makes sense to devote some time each sprint to alleviating some of them. We started an exercise about identifying the anxieties and spending some time researching related ideas. Let's try to keep working on that\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "There still seems to be something unnatural about the process of planning, scoping, executing, and packaging projects. These deliverables have been inconsistent -- full of value, but weighted towards one deliverable or another. I want the time you spend to be flexible to execute how you want to, but part of the process to solidify what you've learned as well as coordinate and work together as a team is to produce the deliverables as designated. The process has been modified to map out precisely when to deliver and note things. If this isn't working, we need to fix it so that it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joint Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the concepts flying around, Runjini had the suggestion that it might be useful to bring back the idea of mapping, but to work in pairs instead of a group facilitated discussion. I think this could be a great format to try to understand and connect the concepts to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing Connections to the Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis follows an analytical process. The modules have been constructed to introduce the components of that process to provide a rough map of the universe of tools and techniques you will probably need to access at some point. Which ones will be specific to your task at whatever time you need it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Roadmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of your roadmap is to 1.) try to anticipate what you might need and learn that now, but more importantly 2.) lay out what you're most curious about and let that drive your learning. Neglecting to plan, neglecting to update and refine your roadmap is a recipe for becoming overwhelmed with all of the conceptual depth, and frustration at scoping projects that might have immediate application, but ultimately don't teach you as much as they could. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to facilitate this, I propose to start off every sprint with a discussion of the analytical process and where the skills would be useful. Following that will be updates to the roadmap before we go into a discussion of the classroom content for the sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Onward!\n",
    "\n",
    "We're all in this together. Your continued input, contributions, and commitment are going to determine whether we are successful collectively. You are an incredibly talented team of people facing an incredibly difficult task. At the end of the day, while it's a long haul, we don't have a lot of time together, so let's make sure we get the most out of\n"

    "# Sprint 4: Data Manipulation Libraries Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Opt-In Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest thing to come out of this sprint was a recognition that some projects and work did not fit particularly well into a standardized group exercise. The group exercises and sprint schedule will still be designed to maximize learning from the collective, but each individual in the cohort will have the opportunity to opt into an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better feedback on project deliverables\n",
    "As projects mature, there's an increasing need to receive feedback on projects and documentation. Requested reviews of documentation, project deliverables, and code reviews all work well. Individual review-requests are a good way to acheive this. If a request goes out on slack, other people can take a look. Tagged people can always take a look, and instrucitonal teal should always review when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project scope that ties back to overall course objectives\n",
    "I think we want to continue to look at projects in the context of the overall objective and not just the conceptual understanding for a given topic. Something that should go into the journal and documentation or whiteboard reflection is: Here's what I think the topic is, and here's how it contributes to my longip term objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wednesday Doc Day\n",
    "Perhaps this is where review requests can go. Another productive idea would be to ask a different question of documentation and projects in the review request. Is this clear to an outsider? Does it contribute to a collective resource? Will this help me remember? Did it clarify or confirm what I thought I knew?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pair Programming and Seeing the language not experienced\n",
    "As another reinforcing exercise and a way to experience a different language, work with a partner on a pair programming exercise so you know what it is like to try to clarify your thoughts as well as so your partner knows how to use the other language. Could be a potential way to produce toolkit notebooks below\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toolkit notebooks\n",
    "One way to simplify what goes into individual notebooks (but potentially make the overall system more complex) would be to break out code snippets into individual notebooks that illustrate techniques that can be used in scripts. This could be a part of sprint review day or doc day depending. Snippet requests based on technical highlights"

    "\n",
    "I think this sprint saw several significant developments in the cohort.\n",
    "(1) large analytical strides were taken and the tools that could be used to analyze and inspect data started to sprout (2) I believe as a group we flexed our ability to absorb difficult technical challenges by building on top of skills we previously developed (3) We improved our ability to navigate the data analysis concept map by finally starting to get a tiny glimpse of how analytical ideas are built up from fundamental ones.\n",

    "## The Beating Heart\n",
    "\n",
    "When the internet and libraries are full of examples of how things work, what creates value for someone who shows up in person? Tori's answer to this question was -- if you're studying biology, actually getting to see a beating heart. You can't get that on the internet. So what does that mean for our professional outcomes oriented data class? Having access to real professionals doing real projects. That is an obvious and clear need, although I haven't known the best place to insert it in our process, but after last week's guest presentation and last week's retrospective discussion, I think a demonstration of relevant projects on the front end (and look forward projects on the back end) of each sprint are both great to work in. And the front end projects (whether by the coaching team, or guest professionals) can serve as that beating heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Socratic Starter\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon and Hunter pointed out that I like to encourage discussions of the topics we're learning, but there's too often, too little to go on, too little context to discuss. There seems to be agreement that there's value in the discussion and debate, but they need some common context. Jon mentioned in Lab school that there was always an activity that preceded their socratic dialogs. Will try to come up with something like this -- whether it's a whiteboard exercise or a coding one -- to seed the discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dividing and conquering concept definitions - through a \"draft\"\n",
    "Like a fantasy sports draft, but less disappointing and injury prone. But honestly, the wikipedia style introduction to topics is probably best done by searching for and picking out resources that work for you and then clarifying your understanding through questions to the cohort and coaching team. It's also useful to compare your understanding to what a peer comes up with. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea here is that after some observing some live specimens (real, localized professional projects) and engaging in a structured exercise, you'd have some connection points to contextualize the concepts for this sprint. And from those connections and that context, you can pick 5-10 topics that are most interesting to you, and do some preliminary research to understand where they fit\n",
    "\n",
    "As you find good links, they get thrown up on slack for later review and for everyone to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Illustrated Clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stage in this socratic discussion is actually getting your brain up on display, so everyone can understand what we think is going on. The coaching staff will illustrate your questions and provisional understanding to confirm your question and attempt to answer it. And the group will get to weigh in by visually following along. And at the end we'll have a visual map to anchor to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept / Skill / Question Self Assessment\n",
    "One of the things I want to constantly keep the cohort tied to is where we are at any given moment in the path toward our respective, ultimate goals for this class. It's a long haul, and a tangly world full of rabbit holes. How do we check in to ensure we're always on track for where we're trying to get to? How do we keep our eyes on the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this suggests a need for a checklist style reminder of key tasks to remember. Part of this is information that I need from you about your evolving conceptual grasp, skill development and interest. To work on both of these issues, Tori and I developed a tool (inspired by Jon's last sprint and self assessment on concepts) that we can use to express goals and self assess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major change involved here is how this will be used. Which is discussed in the next point\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1:1 (optionally public) Consultations\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to really put a lot of emphasis on project scoping. I think this is maybe the key leverage point in this whole process is picking a project that maximizes the learning opportunity, doesn't go down the road of too many distractions, fits into the bigger picture, and includes related skills and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to do this, I think requires individual attention and assessment that can't be done without setting aside dedicated time to doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we don't want to take away too much time from the classroom environment and having to find / carve out new time in everyone's schedules to accommodate this. The compromise idea is to use the Day 2 class primarily for these consultations. WE would be going through the skills self assessments, potentially answering lingering questions, discussing big picture things. Some of that stuff might be useful to everyone. Some of it might be too specialized. So per people's interest, they could be open to attending and listening in in case there's something useful. Or that time could be spent updating portfolios in the classroom context (something we have needed, but not had time for) or using that time however else would best support learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the main thing is that for 45 minutes each member would get the undivided attention of a coach and the outcome would be an updated roadmap, and critically, a skill story (or stories) to tackle for the upcoming sprint and a good idea of the related skills, concepts, and questions to develop as part of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be scheduled ahead of time so you can plan your time around it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the outcome of this class is to have a portfolio to show to future employers or clients, or just to look back at yourselves. However, it never seems to make sense to use class time to tweak and make improvements to projects when the alternative is taking on new concepts and working on new projects. But polishing work is a necessary part of any practice, and I think the optional Day 2 time not spent in a 1:1 consultation or listening in on 1:1 consultation could be a great time to do that. You can be present for your own consultation, listen in on others, use the time to keep your portfolio fresh and get the input of your cohort, or just use the time however you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these are successful, we can also invite people to come in and comment on portfolios and work with you. And you can potentially create more teaching / learning opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Example Project Scavenger Hunt\n",
    "\n",
    "The project pitch has undergone several revisions and evolutions, and per one of runjini's early observations, it's really important to have examples to go on. Benchmarks as well as models are a key part of leveraging the available knowledge base to build your own projects and skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think it's been hard to separate the act of working on your own project (just to start getting your bearings) from looking around for good examples. It's been equally hard to understand what other people are working on well enough to help them find useful examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I think there's tremendous value in being able to explain your skill story and desired project well enough that other people can help you. It also means that they'll be able to help you with things they come across in their own searches (even if working on different things, related things tend to come up).\n",
    "\n",
    "So an evolved approach we've come up with is to spend 10-15 minutes collectively as a group, finding example projects for someone to consider using as models or benchmarks, in a live reverse project pitch session. Here's how it would work\n",
    "\n",
    "- You go in front of the classroom and explain the skill story, skills, questions, etc you are trying to address in your project.\n",
    "- your cohort and coaches will ask clarifying questions about what you're trying to do, why it's relevant\n",
    "- with laptops open, people will do quick searches and send them to slack.\n",
    "- we'll discuss in real time, the project owner will say if it's what he's looking for and if not, what is.\n",
    "- after 10-15 minutes we'll do the process over for the next person\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, hopefully at least 2-3 examples that you will include in your project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Whiteboard Project Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "Day two will include our normal technical prototyping. Based on the examples found and building on what you know, how far can you get. I think this technical prototyping has been working pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal, though is to come up with a project scope. I think this is another area where coaches and project proposers will need to consult in an individual capacity. One exercise that seemed to work pretty well and perhaps was less tedious and more flexible than typing up scope and milestones was the whiteboard scope development. And this can be done in pairs to think through it with a partner. Once the scope is discussed and signed off on by a coach, I think the projects will be well set up for the project work to get done!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meetup / Pizza & Beer Sprint Review\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, if all has been done correctly, a lot of the class will be pretty up to speed on your project. Work in progress udpates, group example finding, pair scoping, maybe pair walkthroughs. So that limits some of the information exchange value of the pair review. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, packaging your project into key insights and practicing communicating the entirely new thing you learned I think has tremendous value. So it is perhaps the case that the best audience for your bi-weekly sprint review presentations is wider than just the cohort. \n",
    "\n",
    "So accordingly, I think it would be to our benefit to structure the sprint review day as a more general meetup format, invite the broader community, and let you communicate what you're working on and why it was cool to you to a general audience. Perhaps inviting in other presenters outside the class to do the same thing. It can be anyone with a project can come in and do. Spend the first hour or two prepping a brief presentation, and the second sharing with the wider community. We can discuss in more detail, but I think there are some natural communities, data science meetup, machine learning meetup, AWS meetup, dev league, etc that we can reach out to and involve more community in what we're doing.\n"

    "\n",
    "As the topics get more difficult, there’s more interest in students working on a similar thing to be able to check work with each other and learn from each other’s progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early in the class, people’s objectives were sufficiently different that it was hard to see what any individual’s work had to do with any other individual’s learning task. These tasks seem to be sufficiently foreign that in order to understand, ears are perking up and learners are listening for any hint of what they don’t comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could represent a general state of desperation, perhaps a sign that the stretch is a bit too far. But it could also suggest the key to the state of mind that is actively listening to the community for possible solutions to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of shared work, however, there do seem to be a things that common work can address. We’ve experimented with two different kinds of in class independent work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared data sets and short term exploration. People seemed to really like that. just to see how far they could get on a new dataset. What they found out about it and what others shared. This seems like a good exercise to start everyone off on, especially given that it’s an exercise that will always need to be undertaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes me think that perhaps we should start the class with Exploratory Data Analysis, so that it is ingrained from the beginning as well as the opportunity to learn from ones classmates. However, the ability to track things in R, was a key learning point here, but there are lots of R tutorials in exploratory analysis. Blind exploration without a set of questions could be a little too broad. But perhaps some preliminary questions to accompany exploratory data analysis is a project approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also experimented with mini-projects. The process seemed to give people a chance to work on a specific skill or in a direction, although not the same as completed project with a product, and people seemed to get lost at some point after exploring. Not the same polish as a full project, but easier to get started. These mini-projects were also a little hard to motivate. They were currently centered around learning any number of the skills on the list, part tutorial, part experiment. It’s probably not necessarily possible to do a tutorial while also doing an experiment. So maybe there should be a distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thought I had was to split up the sprints into a shared group project sprint in a module, and then a project sprint where people got to work on their own scoped project that met their own learning objectives. This could be the difference between assigned projects, assigned concepts, and then perhaps group assigned mini projects (as in the cohort decides what they need to learn more about and how do divide up the mini-project exploration together).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there might be a separate section (maybe the second half of the class that is more like the original sprint projects we were attempting to do. We get into more depth in portfolio projects, figure out how to polish, and perhaps spend a little more time on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence would be \n",
    "- Group Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "- Assigned Data Project\n",
    "- Group Organized Concept Exploration - miniprojects (scrum)\n",
    "- Full Project (either now or in a separate part of the sprint) - this is tied into professional objectives and/or -personal learning objectives.\n"
