# XerCises
You'll find snippets of codes and examples of how to do data and coding tasks in the XerCises directory. If you launch the collection with the badge above, you'll be able to run the code and even add your own notebooks. Download the whole collection and run jupyter notebooks locally for the most flexibility

# Classroom Materials
The content that was prepared for the class as well as the sprint outline materials and self assessment tools, roadmaps, etc, are all included in this folder. It's a great starting point for creating your own roadmap of a learning journey to mastering the data science concepts you need in your own work and projects!
